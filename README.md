# ML_Lab3
For this lab, we used EDA techniques such as Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, etc., to analyze and review a dataset. We have a dataset called "StudentPerformanceFactors.csv" that was used to explore student academic records, where each row represents a student with various attributes like hours studied, attendance, sleep hours, previous scores, and final exam scores. We used different types of libraries such as pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib to load, clean, visualize distributions, and generate a correlation matrix to identify key factors influencing exam performance.
